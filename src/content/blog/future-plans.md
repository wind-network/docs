# The Future of Wind Network

*Published on May 25, 2024*

In this post, we're excited to share our roadmap and vision for the future of Wind Network. As we continue to build our decentralized indexing layer for Solana, we have several exciting developments on the horizon.

## Upcoming Features

### Advanced Query Capabilities

We are working on expanding our query capabilities to include more complex operations, such as aggregations, joins, and advanced filtering options. This will enable developers to extract even more valuable insights from Solana blockchain data.

### Improved Performance

Our team is constantly optimizing the indexing process to reduce latency and increase throughput. The next release will include significant performance improvements, allowing for near real-time data access.

### Enhanced Developer Tools

We're building a comprehensive suite of developer tools to make integration with Wind Network even simpler:

- Interactive API explorer
- SDK extensions for popular frameworks
- Debugging and monitoring utilities

## Community Growth

As our community continues to grow, we're planning to introduce:

- Community grants program for builders
- Regular developer meetups (virtual and in-person)
- Expanded documentation and tutorials

## Get Involved

We believe in building in public and involving our community every step of the way. Here's how you can contribute:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wind-network/windexer.git

# Install dependencies
cd windexer
npm install

# Start contributing!
```

Follow our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/wind-network/windexer/blob/main/README.md) to get started.

Stay tuned for more updates, and we look forward to building the future of decentralized indexing together!

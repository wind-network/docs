# Getting Started with Wind Network

*Published on May 20, 2024*

Wind Network is a decentralized autonomous incentivized indexing layer for Solana. This blog post will walk you through the basics of getting started with Wind Network.

## What is Wind Network?

Wind Network is a new decentralized indexing system built specifically for the high-speed Solana blockchain. It shifts data indexing away from a central point to a network of incentivized participants.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Architecture**: No single point of failure
- **Incentivized Participation**: Rewards for network participants
- **High Performance**: Designed for Solana's throughput
- **Strong Data Consistency**: Reliable data access

## Getting Started

To start using Wind Network, you'll need to:

1. Install the Wind Network SDK
2. Configure your application
3. Connect to the network

```javascript
// Example code for connecting to Wind Network
import { WindClient } from 'wind-network';

const client = new WindClient({
  endpoint: 'https://api.wind.network',
  apiKey: 'your-api-key'
});

// Query indexed data
const results = await client.query({
  collection: 'transactions',
  filter: {
    program: 'TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA'
  }
});
```

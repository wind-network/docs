# Getting Started with Wind Network

Wind Network is a decentralized Solana indexer that processes blockchain data in real-time through a distributed network of nodes. This guide will help you set up and run your own Wind Network node.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Solana CLI tools
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- At least 16GB RAM and 4 CPU cores
- 500GB+ SSD storage (for blockchain data)

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is using our Docker image:

```bash
docker pull windnetwork/node:latest
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v /path/to/data:/data windnetwork/node:latest
```

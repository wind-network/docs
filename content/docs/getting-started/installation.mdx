# Installing Wind Network

This guide provides detailed installation instructions for setting up a Wind Network node from source or using pre-built binaries.

## Installing from Source

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aletheia/wind-network.git
cd wind-network
```

### 2. Build the project

```bash
cargo build --release
```

This will build all the crates in the workspace.

### 3. Install the binary

```bash
cargo install --path crates/windexer-network
```

## Using Pre-built Binaries

We provide pre-built binaries for major platforms:

### Linux (x86_64)

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/aletheia/wind-network/releases/latest/download/wind-network-linux-x86_64.tar.gz | tar xz
cd wind-network
./install.sh
```

### macOS (x86_64)

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/aletheia/wind-network/releases/latest/download/wind-network-macos-x86_64.tar.gz | tar xz
cd wind-network
./install.sh
```

## Docker Installation

We provide a Docker image for easy deployment:

```bash
docker pull windnetwork/node:latest
```

Create a configuration file `config.toml`:

```toml
[network]
listen_addr = "0.0.0.0:9000"
bootstrap_nodes = ["multiaddr/p2p/peer-id-1", "multiaddr/p2p/peer-id-2"]

[geyser]
plugin_path = "/path/to/geyser-plugin.so"

[storage]
data_dir = "/data"
```

Run the container:

```bash
docker run -p 9000:9000 -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /path/to/config.toml:/etc/wind/config.toml \
  -v /path/to/data:/data \
  windnetwork/node:latest
```

## Next Steps

Once you've installed Wind Network, proceed to [configuration](/docs/getting-started/configuration) to set up your node.

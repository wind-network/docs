# Wind Network Architecture

Wind Network is built on a fully decentralized architecture that leverages peer-to-peer (p2p) networking using libp2p. This approach provides high availability, censorship resistance, and horizontal scalability.

## Core Components

The Wind Network architecture consists of several key components:

### Node Types

- **Validator Nodes**: Run by staked validators, these are the core nodes that process and validate Solana blockchain data
- **Light Nodes**: Run by users who want to access indexed data but don't participate in consensus
- **Gateway Nodes**: Public-facing nodes that provide API access to external applications

### System Components

1. **Geyser Plugin**: Connects to Solana validators and streams real-time blockchain data
2. **P2P Network Layer**: Manages connections between nodes using libp2p
3. **Consensus Module**: Ensures data consistency across the network
4. **Storage Engine**: Efficiently stores and indexes blockchain data
5. **API Server**: Provides access to indexed data via RESTful and GraphQL APIs

## Data Flow

The data flows through the system as follows:

1. Solana blockchain generates new blocks and transactions
2. Wind Network Geyser plugin receives this data in real-time
3. Data is processed and validated by validator nodes
4. Consensus is reached on the processed data
5. Data is stored in the local database
6. Indexed data is made available via API

## Security Model

Wind Network's security model is based on Jito restaking, which provides economic incentives for honest behavior:

- Validators must stake tokens to participate
- Malicious behavior can result in slashing of staked tokens
- The consensus algorithm requires a supermajority agreement

# Wind Network Security Model

Wind Network is designed with security as a core principle. As a decentralized Solana indexer, the security of the network is critical to ensure the integrity and availability of indexed data.

## Security Architecture

The Wind Network security architecture is built on several key principles:

### 1. Economic Security via Jito Restaking

Wind Network leverages Jito restaking to provide economic security for the network. Validators must stake SOL tokens to participate in the network, creating economic incentives for honest behavior.

### 2. Distributed Consensus

Wind Network uses a distributed consensus protocol to ensure that nodes agree on the state of indexed data. This provides resilience against attacks and ensures data consistency.

### 3. Cryptographic Verification

All messages in the network are cryptographically signed, ensuring authenticity and integrity of communication between nodes.

### 4. Sybil Resistance

The staking requirement provides resistance against Sybil attacks, where an attacker might attempt to gain control of the network by creating multiple fake identities.

## Threat Model

Wind Network is designed to be resistant to the following threats:

- **51% Attacks**: The consensus mechanism requires a supermajority agreement
- **Eclipse Attacks**: Multiple peer connections and bootstrap nodes minimize isolation risks
- **DDoS Attacks**: Distributed architecture provides resilience against denial-of-service attacks
- **Data Manipulation**: Cryptographic verification prevents unauthorized data modifications

## Security Components

### Validator Security

Validators are required to implement specific security measures:

- Hardware security modules (HSMs) for key management
- Network isolation for critical components
- Regular security audits and compliance checks

### Network Security

The p2p network layer implements several security features:

- Encrypted communication between peers
- Peer authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting to prevent resource exhaustion
- Blacklisting of malicious peers

### API Security

The API layer provides configurable security options:

- JWT-based authentication
- Rate limiting
- CORS configuration
- TLS encryption
